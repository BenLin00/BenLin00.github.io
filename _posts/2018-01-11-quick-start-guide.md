#### My Pod
<\Insert Image here >

This is my Pod from the summer. These are the people I saw on a daily basis. 
I had 2 wonderful intern hosts. I went to them when for all things professional. To be honest, I was super worried about not coming off as competent to them -- it was very hard to read when they were happy with my progress, or disappointed in my performance. But, they always offered their assistance, which is something I am more than grateful for. 

I also had 2 "podmates". They were both good teammates -- none of us expected to be in our own rooms for the summer, but they were really encouraging to me whenever I was struggling. We could talk and laugh about how we were struggling with how things were broken and not working, or how everything we made a mistake with git we would cringe when our hosts mentioned it, or when would accidentally step on each others' toes when merging branches. It was a long burn, but we made it. Maybe I didn't enjoy the summer the same way I expected. There weren't tons of fun events, food everyday, a concert, or a campus.
What I wanted most was just being in a tech office surrounded by other people working on tech projects. What I wanted the most was to casually bump into people with a smile and say "Hi! I'm an intern this summer!". 
Maybe it wasn't super fun, but I still learned a ton. Everytime I explain my entire summer project to a new recruiter, they're seriously impressed with the scope of it. And it makes me realize I need to take a little more pride in my own work too.

#### Imposter Syndrome
I'm sure almost everyone at Google experiences imposter syndrome to some degree, but I really felt it this summer. 

#### Project
My podmates and I build a full-stack web application.
