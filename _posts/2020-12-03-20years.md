#### I turned 20!

Hi!!

I’m writing this a bit late because of Finals Season but at least I got around to it. 

I turned 20 years old. I figured I should write down everything I can remember about my life right now.

I also accumulated a list of 20 things I learned by 20 this past year. That post is <here>


I turned 20 in 2020 and it’s been a wonky year. That’s the best way I can describe it. 
I love being everywhere. I love going a million miles an hour. I love meeting new people with new personalities and new perspectives. I love asking my friend Marissa for her take on something I already know. 

I guess that’s what being a PM is though. It’s not just creative brainstorming and communication. I love really understanding others and how they think or approach anything. 

I’ve spent the semester in quarantine just… vibing. I spent a lot of time just trying to be okay with socializing less, instead of changing the way I socialize. I’ve segmented my socializing to more of an on/off mode. I spent almost all of december just in my room studying for finals, because going to campus is a whole expedition and it takes a lot to coordinate. 

##### Fall 2020
I moved to Illinois for the semester! I packed up and drove up with my parents and my sister, Claire, to UIUC to live with my other sister, Dora. I only knew 2 people coming here: my sister, and a friend from my virtual summer, Nick. I mean, if I’ve learned anything about growth, its to seek discomfort. A motto I love. Before I moved even, I had a friend help me with a facebook auction post on Subtle Asian Dating looking for friends.

##### meeting peeps~

I also searched the facebook group for “UIUC” and “Illinois” and started Instagram DM sliding -- I figured anyone with an auction post had to have some semblance of a social life, and it could be a way to first start meeting people and making friends. It didn’t really work, but it was a p fun mem lol. I also had the thought of “sniping” all the uiuc social fb groups to join all of them.

I met another friend from Maryland! What’s more is I reconnected with a childhood friend, Sam! We played Go at Chinese school growing up together, and went to HS together. There’s so many people I figured I would just never see again and I’ve never dreamed of seeing again. I met a tiktok eboy B.Snipe. I met so many people, but there’s still no one I’d rather be than myself.

The game “Among Us” blew up this semester. There’s a line from it I laugh at: “There is one imposter among us”. It started with just sitting in on a zoom meetings from all these orgs I embedded myself in. I wanted to be a little again and get plugged into a fam. 

And it worked! For the most part. I hit up a bunch of biggos to grab food with. I met a ton of people, and it was pretty sure seeing how everyone was getting tested at least once a week. 

I had the best AAA fam -- a soff biggie named Sara, a couple wild sibbies Fran and Eric, and gbig Jeffrey, and all the extended Fam. A friend called Erica (or Cherica), and everyone in between.
