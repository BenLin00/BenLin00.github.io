<h5> Spotify Public Queue Feature </h5>
<h6> "Tell me about your favorite product and what you would change about it" </h6>
<p> That is the most common PM interview question I get asked. I decided to make a mock-up of exactly what my response is. Here's my response: <br>
I really enjoy Spotify as an avid music listener. It's great for organizing your favorite music, managing playlists, and discovering new music. One of its weaker points is when it comes to sharing music with others. A fan-favorite feature of the webapp is the right column "Friend Activity" scroll -- I enjoy seeing what my friends are listening to in real time, and many of my friends do too! Let's incorporate this into a new proposed feature. <br> <br>

Currently, users right click on a song > share and send their friends a link to a song over another social media app or as a url. This is a bit clunky -- it's annoying to receive a message and stop doing whatever you're doing just to listen to a song. It's distracting and obstructive. If a customer is wanting and able to listen to music, they would already be listening to music. Sending someone a song over social media just gets ignored until an appropriate time. Instead, I designed a way to casually recommend songs for a mutually following friend. <br> <br>

This would have a search bar on the friend activity column so that users can search by name the user they want to send a song to, combined with the drag + drop UI that Spotify users are already familiar with, so users don't experience frustration with learning how to use a new feature. This is shown as with the demo below: <br>

<br>
New song suggestions are paired up with a new <b> Public Queue </b> in addition to the users' current private queue. Songs displayed in this public queue would appear similarly to a shared playlist, listing the user who added the song and ability to sort songs. However, when songs from this playlist are played, they will be removed from the listing as with a queue. The queue layout including the new public queue is displayed below: <br>

<br>
Practically speaking, this is a seamless integration of increased social interaction of users on the platform. It may also encourage potential customers to become Spotify users as another way to casually connect with friends.

<h6> USE CASES </h6>
Often times, social gatherings are associated with actively playing music. Multiple people wish to queue-up song requests at events. However, this requires crowding around a single device, or utilizing Spotify's beta Group Sessions, where users can only override the currently playing song at max 5 users.

<h5> Target COVID-19 Store Occupany Tracker </h5>
<h1> insert image here </h1>

<h6> Hackathon Winner: "Overall Winner" and "Most Technically Challenging" </h6> 
<p> As part of the Target Diversity Leadership Symposium Conference during August 2020, I worked on project with 3 teammates to design an app that would help customers locate nearby Target stores and how crowded each store is as it reaches maximum COVID-19 regulated capacity. <br>

<h6> Background </h6>
We created a mock-up of what this application would look like. During events such as Black Friday, when stores experience overcrowding, an employee is often stationed at each entrance to limit the number of customers inside at a single time. This has become even more common with the further limited occupancy due to social distancing requirements. This Fall 2020 Semester, a new Target store opened up next to UIUC campus, where I was located. Nearly every other day during its first month of opening, there was a line of people waiting outside to enter the store (and there weren't even special event sales!). <br> <br>

<h6> Description </h6>
This app allows users to view nearby Target stores according to the user's GPS location. Store locations are highlighted on a Google Map Services-powered map in color according to occupancy-- <br>
Red: if there is a line of people waiting outside store <br> Yellow: if the store is approximately at max occupancy <br> Green: if the store occupancy is not near max occupancy. <br>
